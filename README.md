# Adventure Game
 Adventure Game is a console game. 

There are 3 game characters, which every one of them has it's own special characteristic and the player can select one of them and start to play.
There are 4 different locations in the game. The player's tasks is in three of them. Just one location is not neccessary to go there and that location name is Mine Location.

The aim of Mine locatoin is just for getting random prize like money or weapon or armor or nothing, beacause the prize is not clear and will be determied randomly.
   If the player's blood is getting low then he/she can go to the SafeHouse Location to fill his/her blood. After the player finished all his/her task in the related locations,
he/she shloud go to SafeHouse Location. In SafeHouse, it is checked if the player has done successfully all his/her tasks or not. If no, then the game will continue if yes, then
the game is finised.

I wrote all the important explanations which makes the code easier to understand. Hope it can help you.)
